 <div>Depending on how you obtained the Windows 
software, this is a license agreement between (i) you and the 
device manufacturer or software installer that distributes the 
software with your device; or (ii) you and Microsoft 
Corporation (or, based on where you live or, if a business, 
where your principal place of business is located, one of its 
affiliates) if you acquired the software from a retailer. 
Microsoft is the device manufacturer for devices produced by 
Microsoft or one of its affiliates, and Microsoft is the retailer 
if you acquired the software directly from Microsoft. Note 
that if you are a volume license customer, use of this 
software is subject to your volume license agreement rather 
than this agreement.
