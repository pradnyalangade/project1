 Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, this is a license 
agreement between (i) you and the device manufacturer or software installer 
that distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you and Microsoft 
Corporation (or, based on where you live or, if a business, where your principal 
place of business is located, one of its affiliates) if you acquired the software 
from a retailer. Microsoft is the device manufacturer for devices produced by 
Microsoft or one of its affiliates, and Microsoft is the retailer if you acquired 
the software directly from Microsoft. Note that if you are a volume license 
customer, use of this software is subject to your volume license agreement 
rather than this agreement.
